- we need to tint the nodes for things that make sense: green/cyan/red

- the nodes' screen scaling needs work. we need to set a max angular res.

- we need a nicer TreeVis::surround_with_circle() method for the active etc.

- fix the path solver so it finds the shortest point to an ALREADY active node NOT origin.

- UI for class select

- save characters

- load characters

- rename poo to poe

- rename visualiser to vis
