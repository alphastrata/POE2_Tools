We have a good start on working with our tree data in src/data.rs

We are making progress with our helper methods and such that help us get around and best navigate the tree.

I want you to based on the tests in src/data.rs implemetn a few more:
'Avatar of Fire' -> 'Resolute Technique' -> 'Strong Chin' -> 'Fervour' -> 'Chaos Inoculation' -> 'Over Exposure' which should be 99-5 steps.

Also ensure that those match their NodeID from the poe2_tree.json


Next i'd like your thoughts on refactoring and encapsulating some of our growing functionality it seem se need to think about backend (does compute n stuff) and frontend (egui visualising things...)
