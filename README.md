# POO TOOLS

I created this because I couldn't quite achieve what I wanted on maxroll.gg or with PathOfBuilding. This tool is intended more for people experimenting with the POE2 passive tree rather than those looking to fully plan and optimize their buildsâ€”there are plenty of tools for that, and they do a great job.

# Scope

## API

- Basic pathing and cumulative stats information about possible paths
- Advice for reducing the _frontier_ of a path by `n` moves to respec in another direction and optimize for criteria like `evasion_rating` or `energy_shield`. By taking an existing path, we see if it can be altered for the same number of levels, even considering a few `fixed` `node_id`s, thereby changing stats and showing users the deltas.
- Loading and saving characters (which include name, class, starting_node, and a bunch of activated nodes)

Character schema is:

```toml
character_class = "Monk"
name = "jengablox"
activated_node_ids = [30555, 49046, 53960, 10364, 55342, 17248]
date_created = "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"
level = 6
quest_passive_skills = 0
starting_node = 10364
```

## Visualizations

- Basic visualization efforts
- Visualization characteristics like:

```text
nodes
edges
highlighting
activating/deactivating nodes
camera zoom
camera sensitivity
default temporary file paths
default zoom
key bindings
mouse bindings
```

These should be configurable through a user-friendly `user_config.toml` whose schema is:

```toml
#$ data/user_config.toml
[colors]
# Node Colors
attack = "#E95678"          # Red
mana = "#26BBD9"            # Blue
dexterity = "#29D398"       # Green
intelligence = "#26BBD9"    # Blue
strength = "#E95678"        # Red
all_nodes = "#3C3C3C"       # Dark grey
activated_nodes = "#29D398" # Green
activated_edges = "#22A882" # Green

# UI Colors
background = "#1C1E26"
foreground = "#C7C9CB"
red = "#E95678"
orange = "#FAB795"
yellow = "#FABD2F"
green = "#29D398"
blue = "#26BBD9"
purple = "#EE64AC"
cyan = "#59E3E3"

[controls]

move_left = ["h", "left_arrow"]
move_right = ["i", "right_arrow"]
move_up = ["e", "up_arrow"]
move_down = ["n", "down_arrow"]
camera_reset_home = ["esc"]

search_for_node_by_name = ["f"]
exit = ["q"]
load_character_nodes = ["l"]

#TODO: base_node_size
#TODO: default camera_zoom
#TODO: zoom sensitivity
#TODO: translate_sensitivity
#TODO: lock_camera_when_typing
#TODO: screen dimensions (save last camera position and window size)

```

- Loading a character in the visualizer should plot your path correctly.

- Orphaned nodes should be removed from the path and revert to default highlighting (i.e., none).

- Edges should light up when nodes are activated.

- Active nodes' `.stats` should accumulate into a stat sheet for your character, computed on-the-fly.

- The stat sheet is a left-hand side menu (toggleable with the same default key as the game uses).
